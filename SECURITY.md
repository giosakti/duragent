# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 0.4.x   | Yes                |
| < 0.4   | No                 |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Duragent, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead:

1. Email the maintainer directly or use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/giosakti/duragent/security/advisories/new)
2. Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact
3. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

## What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours of your report
- **Status update** within 7 days with an assessment and expected timeline
- **Fix and disclosure** coordinated with you before public announcement

## Scope

This policy applies to the Duragent core runtime and first-party plugins (e.g. `duragent-gateway-discord`, `duragent-gateway-telegram`). Third-party plugins are the responsibility of their respective maintainers.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure. Once a fix is available, we will:

1. Release a patched version
2. Publish a security advisory on GitHub
3. Credit the reporter (unless they prefer anonymity)
