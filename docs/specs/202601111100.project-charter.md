# Project Charter: Duragent

## Vision

**Duragent** is a durable, portable runtime for AI agents.

- **Sessions that survive** — crash, restart, reconnect from any terminal: duragent is durable by design
- **Transparent state** — agent specs, memories, and sessions are human-readable files you can inspect, version, and export
- **Sandboxed by default** — bubblewrap on Linux; Docker or trust mode on other platforms
- **Pluggable everything** — file-based by default; bring your own storage or messaging backends
- **Edge-ready** — single-binary core (~10-15MB), gateway plugins are optional separate binaries

Core protocols built-in (CLI, HTTP, SSE). Platform integrations via plugins.

Self-host it directly, or use it as the foundation for agent-powered products.

## Problem Statement

Current agent frameworks require either buying into a heavy framework, using proprietary cloud-only services with no export path, running full container infrastructure for basic sandboxing, or building session persistence from scratch.

Duragent fills the gap: a lightweight, portable runtime for durable sessions and transparent state that you can build on.

## Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Durable sessions** — Sessions survive crashes, restarts, and reconnects; attach from any terminal
2. **Transparent, portable state** — Agent specs, memories, and sessions are human-readable files
3. **Lightweight sandboxing** — Bubblewrap for lightweight isolation; support for more will be added
4. **Pluggable backends** — File-based by default; optional external storage (Postgres, Redis, S3)
5. **Core protocols built-in** — CLI/TUI, HTTP REST, SSE for real-time streaming
6. **Platform plugins** — Telegram, Discord, Slack via subprocess plugin protocol
7. **Standards-compliant** — MCP for tools, A2A for discovery
8. **LLM-agnostic** — OpenRouter (v0.1), OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama (v0.2+), any OpenAI-compatible API
9. **Single binary** — ~10-15MB core, starts in milliseconds; gateway plugins ship separately

### Secondary Goal: Edge & Embedded Capability

Duragent should run on resource-constrained devices (Raspberry Pi, edge servers, IoT gateways):

- **Single binary** — no additional software to install for core runtime
- **Low memory footprint** — Target <50MB runtime memory
- **ARM-native** — First-class support for ARM64 and ARM32
- **Offline-capable** — Works with local LLMs without internet
- **Crash-resilient** — Immediate persistence ensures graceful recovery from power loss

## Non-Goals (v1.0)

- Web UI or visual builder
- Complex multi-agent protocols (we support supervisor→worker patterns, not mesh)
- Built-in RAG/vector search (use MCP tools)
- Workflow/DAG execution engine
- User authentication (application layer concern)
- Competing with llama.cpp/Ollama on inference (we integrate with them)
- Competing with Claude Code/OpenCode/Aider (we orchestrate them)

## Design Principles

### 1. Durable by Default

- Sessions survive crashes, restarts, and reconnects
- State is always persisted before execution continues
- No hidden in-memory state that disappears on failure

### 2. Transparent & Portable

- Agent specs are human-readable YAML + Markdown
- State files are inspectable (JSONL, YAML, Markdown)
- Export everything, migrate anywhere

### 3. Lean Core, Pluggable Edges

- Core protocols built-in (CLI, HTTP, SSE)
- Platform integrations via plugins
- Storage backends are swappable
- Add features only when real use cases demand them

### 4. Practical Security

- Trust mode for local development
- Lightweight sandboxing (bubblewrap) for isolation without Docker
- Heavier isolation is on the roadmap
- Capabilities are explicit and configurable

### 5. Observability-First

- Structured event stream for all operations
- Tool calls, file operations, and errors are inspectable
- Clients can replay and audit what happened
