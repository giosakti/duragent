# Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

## Expected Behavior

- Be kind and courteous
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Give and accept constructive feedback gracefully
- Assume good intent — focus on what is best for the community

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Insults, derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Trolling or deliberate intimidation
- Harassment (public or private)
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening a GitHub issue or contacting the maintainer directly.

## Enforcement

Violations will be addressed with progressive responses: a warning, followed by temporary removal, and then a permanent ban for repeated violations. Maintainers reserve discretion to reverse bans for first offenses with genuine apologies.
